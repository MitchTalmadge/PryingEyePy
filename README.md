## Project Description

Don't mind the dust (WIP)

#### Models/
The Models directory holds all the saved, recognized, "safe" faces

### Technical Notes
To install on Windows:
```cmd
scoop install cmake
pip install dlib
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
`CMake` must be installed prior to `dlib`. The `face_recognition` lib uses `dlib`.
